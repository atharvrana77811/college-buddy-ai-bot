👨‍💻 About

I’m Atharv Rana, a B.Tech student who stopped waiting to “become good at coding someday” and started building useful AI tools right now.

I explore Python, automation, AI workflows, and student-focused products — and turn them into real projects instead of college assignments that nobody uses.

College Buddy AI is my first open-source bot.
Not perfect. Not advanced.
But it works — and it solves an actual student problem.

This repo marks the start of my dev journey.
More projects coming.


Built by a B.Tech student for engineering students who want guidance, project ideas, and the latest tech updates without wasting time searching the internet.
